   <h1> The Computer Keyboard </h1>
   <h2> What's directly under the keys? </h2>
   <p> When you first look into a keyboard, you see that there is a hole in the keyboard and that the key has a corresponding
   cylindrical bar on its underside. The key goes through this hole and is stopped by a rubber layer below that also acts as a
   spring. </p>
   <h2> What's under the keyboard? </h2>
   <p> A keyboard contains multiple transparent plastic layers underneath through which the round bars that match with the
   keys' can be seen. The keyboard also contains several LEDS on a green rectangle, for the CAPS, NUM, and Scroll locks as
   well as an electrical wire that joins the keyboard to the rest of the computer. On the underside of a keyboard, there are
   rubber stoppers secured by several electrical layers that cause the keys to bounce up and down while the user types. </p>
   <h2> How do the transparent layers under the keyboard work? </h2>
   <p> For starters, there are three plastic layers under a computer &mdash; two of which have an electrically conductive
   metallic material that are arranged in the form of lines on the surface and the remainder of which has holes in it and goes
   between these two layers. When a key is pressed down, the top and bottom layers touch each other through these holes and the
   electrically conductive metallic material allows a circuit to be completed for that specific key by transferring the
   corresponding electrical energy across the plastic layer. The electrical signals are transferred to the monitor via the CPU
   as different letters, which allows users to view different letters on a screen depending on what key is pressed. </p>
