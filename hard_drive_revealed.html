		<h1> The Hard Drive - Revealed </h1>
		<h2> How it works </h2>
		<ol>
		<li> An actuator moves the read-write arm, but now voice coils similar to those in loudspeakers are used because they
		are less sensitive to temperature changes and can move more precisely. </li>
		<li> The read-write arm moves the read-write head. </li>
		<li> The central spindle allows the platter or disk to move easily. </li>
		<li> The platter stores information in binary form that is magnetized in a similar way to how nails are magnetized. </li>
		<li> Plug connections allow the hard disk drive to transport data to the motherboard. </li>
		<li> The read-write head is a small magnet head on the tip of the read-write arm. </li>
		<li> The circuit board on the underside controls the flow of data to and from the platter. </li>
		<li> The flexible connector allows information from the motherboard to reach the read-write arm and platter, which is
		how information can be changed on a hard-drive. </li>
		<li> The small spindle on the read-write arm allows for non-restricted movement. </li>
		</ol>
		<h2> How exactly does the hard drive store such information? </h2>
		<p> Well, the hard drive has its bits of data arranged in circular paths called tracks, which are further divided into
		sectors and part of the hard drive stores a map of the fully-used sectors to tell the computer where to tell the hard
		drive to store information in the platter. </p>
		<h2> Disadvantages </h2>
		<p> It may be almost impossible to think of disadvantages, but they exist, and some may include the fact that the
		read-write arm is very sensitive to dust and can move up and down unpredictably, which may cause the loss of all, or
		almost all of the data stored on the hard drive. </p>
