  	<!-- The following four headings are at the first heading-level to distinguish them from other headings as they are more
  	general and important headings. -->
  	<h1  id= "introduction">  How do Computers Work? </h1>
  	<p> Simply put, a computer is meant to perform 3 basic functions: take input from the user, process said input, and present
    the processed data as output to the user.  The computer takes input using input or peripheral devices, such as a joystick,
	keyboard, and mouse. This input is sent to the only computer component that processes data, the CPU. Keyboard input,
	for example, is sent to the CPU via a complete circuit formed by the keys’ electrical counterparts. The
	<a href = "keyboard_info.html"> keyboard </a> webpage explains this concept in much more detail. This component then
	sends the processed information to the output devices, which includes the monitor, speakers, and printer drive.
	The monitor, for example, can output picture data using pixels of which the colour numbers were assigned by the CPU. The
	computer hardware affects the output devices. For example, a plentiful supply of RAM can allow the computer to function
	quickly and efficiently, which is especially useful for gaming software.  </p> 
  	<h1 id= "parts"> The Parts of a Computer </h1>
  	<p> A computer consists of many internal parts that help it to achieve the three basic functions outlined above. But before 
   diving into the types of parts and their functions, it is necessary to explain how we disassembled and reassembled our
   system unit. </p>
  	<h1 id = "disassembly"> Steps in the disassembly process </h1>
  	<p> Note: Each time a part was detached from the computer, our group took a picture of it labelled. </p>
  	<img src = "Before_image.jpg" alt = "Internal components of a computer's system unit" width = "250" height = "400">
  	<!-- We chose the container div for image captions because there is no font formatting for the tag and so captions will
  	appear smaller than the real text, differentiating them appropriately.-->
  	<div> The system unit's appearance before disassembly. <div>
  	<p> Inspect case. We noticed releases on the side. We pressed them and opened the case. The first thing we disassembled was
  	the drive on top of the power supply. We noticed the power supply screws were in an unreachable position, so we left that
  	be. The ROM drive, floppy drive, and hard disk drive were removed by clicking on the green releases and buses disconnected
  	from the motherboard and these components. We then removed the CPU’s cooling fan, and then the heatsink for the CPU. Wires
  	for  the fan were disconnected. We removed the CPU, and removed the heatsink to access the intel graphics. We then removed
  	the RAM along with more cables from the power supply unit. The BIOS’ battery was then quickly detached. After some trial
  	and error, we figured out how to remove the motherboard itself by noticing a green release and other releases on the 
  	bottom. Additional screws and plugs had to be removed, as well as the ports such as the USB port.  The box almost empty, we
  	still could not remove the PSU screws. They were located so that they were only reachable by the screwdriver in a position
  	that was blocked by the frame. There was a “warranty void if removed” sticker, so we thought it was not meant to be
  	removed. After unplugging the front ports, the box was at last empty, barring the PSU. </p>
  	<img src = "Empty_system_unit.jpg" alt = "Emptied system unit" width = "250" height = "400">
  	<div> The best possible attempt at an empty system unit by our group. </div>
  	</ol>
  	<h1 id = "reassembly"> Steps in the reassembly process </h1>
  	<p> We first put the storage disks back into the computer because they were fairly easy to position as they only needed to
  	be slided back into place. Next, we put the motherboard back into the system unit. The BIOS’ battery was secured on the
  	motherboard.The RAM and drive on the power supply unit were next on the list of reassembling components, and we made sure
  	we heard a click before moving on. The CPU, after trying several times to secure it, was accompanied by its heatsink and
  	cooling fan. The Intel graphics’ heatsink was locked into position soon after. Since the PSU was not already taken out, we
  	simply left the box be at this point. The only thing we had to do during this time was to ensure that the screws were put
  	into place. </p>
  	<img src = "after_image.jpg" alt = "Finished reassembled product showing the internal components of a computer's system unit
   " width = "250" height = "400">
   <div> As you can see, the final image of the system unit's interior looks exactly the same as the original. </div>
  	<h2 id = "thermal_paste"> Thermal Paste </h2>
  	<p> A thermal paste is applied on components that will be in contact with a heatsink. Its purpose is to transfer the heat,
  and prevent any air gaps between the two. The heatsink is then cooled off by the cooling fan. </p>
  	<h2> Heat Sink </h2>
  	<img src = "Heat_sink.jpg" alt = "Heat sink of a computer" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p> The heat sink has a similar purpose to the cooling fan; it absorbs heat energy released by components such as the CPU
 and Power Supply Unit due to fast-moving data and electrical currents. They need to be cooled due to the fact that they are
 semi-conductors and will transfer heat to the outside environment, especially during heavy usage. It is made from metal and
  touches the thermal paste and component.</p> 
  	<h2 id = "intel_graphics"> Intel Graphics </h2>
  	<img src = "Intel_graphics.jpg" alt = "Intel graphics on a computer" width = "300" height = "350">
  	<p> The Intel Graphics is a Graphics Processing Unit that is integrated with the CPU and can interact with it to improve
 image quality. </p> 
  	<h2 id = "storage"> Computer Storage </h2>  
  	<p> A computer's storage can be removable (e.g. floppy disk drives) and non-removable (e.g. ROM and the hard disk drives). </p>
  	<h3 id = "floppy_disk_drive"> Floppy Disk Drive </h3>
   <img src = "Floppy_disk_drive.jpg" alt = "Floppy disk drive" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p>  Another type of removal storage, but it is now considered obsolete as CD/DVD drives became the norm. The floppy disk
 drive reads information from a floppy disk that can be removed and does not lose its contents during a power outage, like
 a USB drive. </p>  
  	<h3 id ="cd_rom_drive"> CD ROM Drive </h3>  
  	<img src = "CD_ROM_drive.jpg" alt = "CD ROM drive with green releases" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p> This drive reads audio or software information that can only be read from optical disks. Usually the information
 that is read-only was produced during the manufacturing process. The surface of a CD has several high and low points due to
 its microscopic bumps and can only be read with a microscopic light beam known as a laser beam. This beam of light detects
 these high and low points, and sends back corresponding signals in binary form to the CPU. DVDs, or digital versatile disks
 can be compared to CDs, but can store more data in the same size as a standard CD. </p>
  	<h3 id = "hard_disk_drive"> Hard Disk Drive </h3>
  	<img src = "Hard_disk_drive.jpg" alt = "Hard disk drive exterior" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p> When the computer turns off, the hard disk drive is one of the things that doesn't lose its content, as the programs and
 files are stored permanently.  A hard disk drive is used for long-term magnetic memory, and large amounts of data organised under
 directories can be stored on it. The hard disk reads them with a magnetic hand and then sends it in binary form to the CPU.
 The read and write hand moves and reads/writes in magnetic form as said above. As the disk spins at high speeds, any part can
 be read from.  But this only skims the surface of how a hard drive works. The <a href = "hard_drive_revealed">
 hard drive </a> webpage is available for more details.</p>
  	<h2 id ="main_board">  Motherboard/Main Board </h2>
	<img src = "Motherboard.jpg" alt = "Motherboard with all hardware components attached" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p> The mainboard, also known as the motherboard allows the other hardware components to communicate with one another.
 Home to many of the essential components of the computer such as the CPU, BIOS, RAM, and expansion slots, the organization
 of the mainboard is similar to that of a city  as all main parts are connected by &rdquo;roads&rdquo;, which are, in this case
 , electrically conductive. The electrical signals conducted through them carry what is presently known as information, the
definition being the words, pictures and sounds that can be perceived by the senses. The motherboard is essential for the PC to
work. </p>
  	<h2 id ="cooling_fan"> Cooling Fan </h2>
  	<img src = "Cooling_fan.jpg" alt = "Cooling fan paired with the CPU" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p> Pulls in cool air, which absorbs the heat being transferred from the Central Processing Unit (CPU, or power supply). The hot air is then fanned away, out of the case. A cooling fan is plugged into the motherboard, and does not require a lot of power. With low usage of computer processing, the speed could be around 2000 RPM. High cooling demand may see fans running at around 7000 RPM, with many newer fans doing upwards of 15 000 RPM. </p>
  	<h2 id ="cpu"> CPU </h2>
  	<img src = "CPU.jpg" alt = "Central Processing Unit microchip" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p>  CPU - The Central Processing Unit, carries electrical signals at a very fast rate, and is colloquially considered
 the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of the computer. It is responsible for executing programs and performing arithmetic and logical operations. </p>
  	<h2 id ="memory"> Memory </h2>
	<p> Computer memory is the information that is stored on a computer, whether temporarily or permanently, that interact with
 the computer output devices and are perceived by the user. The two most commonly known types of memory are the RAM and ROM, 
but there also exists cache memory, flash memory, and virtual memory. </p>
	<h3 id = "ram"> RAM/ Random Access Memory </h3>
	<img src = "RAM.jpg" alt = "RAM card" width = "300" height = "250">
	<p> This grid-like system stores data that can be directly accessed. The data, however, can only be stored temporarily as it
 is not saved (i.e. kept in the computer&rsquo;s long-term memory) when the computer switches off. RAM is also volatile, meaning
 that it can be subject to changes. </p>
  	<h3 id= "bios"> BIOS / Basic Input Output System </h3>
  	<img src = "BIOS.jpg" alt = "BIOS microchip" width = "300" height = "320">
  	<p> The BIOS, which runs on a battery that should be changed occasionally, is the computer component that usually contains
 the instructions for a computer to follow during the startup process. One of its most important duties is to make sure that
 the operating system is correctly loaded into memory during this process because if the operating system is wrongly loaded
 into memory, that could hinder the interaction of the computer hardware with the computer application software.</p>
  	<h3 id ="rom"> ROM </h3>
	<p> The computer ROM is memory that is permanently stored into the computer. It is usually used to access the code written
during the computer manufacturing process that tells the computer what to do during the startup process. </p>
	<h2 id ="cards"> Expansion Slots/Cards </h2>
	<img src = "Expansion_slots.jpg" alt = "Expansion slots, including a video card slot and sound card slot on the motherboard" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p> Slots on the motherboard that may be used to install additional specialized components such as graphics cards and sound
 cards. These expansions each perform a unique task, making the computer run faster and enable users to perform previously 
 impossible tasks. The two types of expansion slots on a computer are the AGP and PCI slots. </p>
	<h3 id ="agp_slot"> AGP Slot </h3>
	<p> These card slots work very quickly because they have to deal with image data, which so often comes in huge amounts that
 need to be sent to the CPU and then the monitor for the user to view the images. Also known as an AGP (i.e. Accelerated
 Graphics Port) slot. </p>
	<h3 id ="pci_slot"> PCI Slot </h3>
	<p> These card slots do not need to work as quickly as a graphics because the amount of data from sound is fewer than that of
 images. </p>
  	<h2 id ="power_supply_unit"> Power Supply Unit </h2>
  	<img src = "PSU.jpg" alt = "Power supply unit without the drive on top of it" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p> Provides power from a wall outlet into the computer. Typically, it comes with its own cooling fan. The PSU delivers
 power to all of the components, although larger output devices are powered separately, such as monitors and printers. The
 power supply unit supplies power in two voltages, 5 volts for the circuit board and 12 volts for motor-driven devices such
 as the hard disk drive. </p>
  	<h2 id ="ports"> Ports </h2>
  	<p> Ports, like expansion slots, allow computers to access information from external sources, such as a video camera for the 
  firewire port and a USB drive for the USB port. These ports are connected to the motherboard and hence the CPU via several
  buses. </p>
	<h3 id ="firewire_port"> Firewire Port </h3>
	<p> One of the important ports is the firewire port. A video camera is usually plugged into them as its information comes in
very large quantities and the port is able to keep up with this fast-moving information. </p>
	<h3 id ="ethernet_port"> Ethernet Port </h3>
	<p> Another well-known port is the Ethernet port, which allows for high-speed connection to the Internet. </p>
	<h3 id ="USB_port"> USB Port </h3>
	<img src = "USB_port.jpg" alt = "A green USB port removed from the inside of the system unit with a bus connection" width = "300" height = "250">
	<p>  The USB port, another port, allows an external connection between a Universal Serial Bus and the computer hardware. It is also known
 as an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory due to how easily it can be edited by the user. The USB can,
 through the port and with the help of the CPU, transfer information to the monitor to be displayed to the user. The USB
 fortunately does not lose information when power outages occur. There are various ports for input and output. </p>

  	<h2 id ="bus"> Ribbon Cables/Bus </h2>
  	<img src = "Bus.jpg" alt = "Electrical computer bus" width = "300" height = "250">
  	<p>  The bus is an electrical medium through which electrical signals move from the outer peripheral devices of a
 computer to the internal hardware.</p>
  	<h2 id ="battery"> Battery </h2>  
  	<img src = "Battery.jpg" alt = "Computer battery for the BIOS" width = "300" height = "325">
  	<p> The battery, as above-mentioned, powers the BIOS and is therefore essential for the proper functioning of a computer. </p>
